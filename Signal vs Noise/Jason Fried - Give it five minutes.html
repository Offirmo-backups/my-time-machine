<div class="post-content">
  <p>A few years ago I used to be a hothead. Whenever anyone said 
anything, I’d think of a way to disagree. I’d push back hard if 
something didn’t fit my world-view.</p>


	<p>It’s like I had to be first with an opinion – as if being first 
meant something. But what it really meant was that I wasn’t thinking 
hard enough about the problem. The faster you react, the less you think.
 Not always, but often.</p>


	<p>It’s easy to talk about knee jerk reactions as if they are things 
that only other people have. You have them too. If your neighbor isn’t 
immune, neither are you.</p>


	<p>This came to a head back in 2007. I was speaking at the Business 
Innovation Factory conference in Providence, RI. So was Richard Saul 
Wurman. After my talk Richard came up to introduce himself and 
compliment my talk. That was very generous of him. He certainly didn’t 
have to do that.</p>


	<p>And what did I do? I pushed back at him about the talk he gave. 
While he was making his points on stage, I was taking an inventory of 
the things I didn’t agree with. And when presented with an opportunity 
to speak with him, I quickly pushed back at some of his ideas. I must 
have seemed like such an asshole.</p>


	<p>His response changed my life. It was a simple thing. He said “Man, 
give it five minutes.” I asked him what he meant by that? He said, it’s 
fine to disagree, it’s fine to push back, it’s great to have strong 
opinions and beliefs, but give my ideas some time to set in before 
you’re sure you want to argue against them. “Five minutes” represented 
“think”, not react. He was totally right. I came into the discussion 
looking to prove something, not learn something.</p>


	<p>This was a big moment for me.</p>


	<p>Richard has spent his career thinking about these problems. He’s 
given it 30 years. And I gave it just a few minutes. Now, certainly he 
can be wrong and I could be right, but it’s better to think deeply about
 something first before being so certain you’re right.</p>


	<p>There’s also a difference between asking questions and pushing back.
 Pushing back means you already think you know. Asking questions means 
you want to know. Ask more questions.</p>


	<p>Learning to think first rather than react quick is a life long 
pursuit. It’s tough. I still get hot sometimes when I shouldn’t. But I’m
 really enjoying all the benefits of getting better.</p>


	<p>If you aren’t sure why this is important, think about this quote from Jonathan Ive regarding Steve Jobs’ reverence for ideas:</p>


<blockquote>
And just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the 
process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I 
think he better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can 
be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily
 missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.
</blockquote>

	<p>That’s deep. Ideas are fragile. They often start powerless. They’re barely there, so easy to ignore or skip or miss.</p>


	<p>There are two things in this world that take no skill: 1. Spending other people’s money and 2. Dismissing an idea.</p>


	<p>Dismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn’t involve any work. 
You can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. 
That’s easy. The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it 
marinate, explore it, riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start
 out life as the wrong idea.</p>


	<p>So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, 
pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a
 little bit before pushing back, before saying it’s too hard or it’s too
 much work. Those things may be true, but there may be another truth in 
there too: It may be worth it.</p>

    <p>This is something I’m still learning how to do. I believe it 
takes commitment to the idea that we are wrong often and trying to be 
humble.  My friends and family at times have said I’m a know-it-all. 
There may be moments where that was absolutely true but I honestly feel 
the more experience(failures) I have the less that I believe I’m 
“right.” Having an opinion doesn’t mean you are a know it all but 
believe you are always right <strong>is</strong>.</p>

    <p>Great article, especially since you related it to a personal 
experience. I’d say it also applies to the opposite too, when you’re 
sold on an idea too quickly and find yourself caught in the pitch or the
 hype, sometimes you just have to take a step back and think it through.</p>

<blockquote>
His response changed my life [...] not learn something.</blockquote>

	<p>Not to completely prove your point, but I disagree. I think the 
conversation - the ‘push back’ is fine in a forum like this. You have 
two speakers on firm ground who are both coming from positions of 
strength on equalish footing. A bit of push back and forth, so long as 
it’s intellectually honest and elaborative, is fine - good even.</p>




	<p>True, but these gems are not (should not be) the ones shared at a 
discussion like the above. Certainly bullying your staff or throwing 
ideas out before they get a chance to take root.</p>

    <p>And I bet this sort of thing actually produced tangible benefits 
for 37Sig.  Withholding judgment on BOTH the positives and negatives can
 let you freewheel about possibilities without punishing or rewarding 
egos in the room.  This Rush-To-Judgment is just a cancer in most 
companies.</p>


	<p>Like Jobs said, ideas in their infancy are almost totally unable to 
“protect themselves” and usually die a swift and soundless death in a 
corporate rush to judgment about its lack of merit.</p>


	<p>Most companies are Ego Driven… not Idea Driven.  Which is why if you
 (corp Execs) REALLY push for the generation of ideas without egos or 
rush-to-judgment, you already have an incredible competitive advantage.</p>

    <p>Great stuff.  Reminds me a bit of Steven B. Sample’s idea of “thinking gray”.</p>


	<p>He says conventional wisdom considers snap judgements to be an asset.</p>


	<p>But “contrarian wisdom argues that…judgments as to the truth or 
falsity of information or the merits of new ideas should be arrived at 
as slowly and subtly as possible – and in many cases not at all.”</p>


	<p>The essence is “why form an opinion until you’ve heard all the 
relevant facts and arguments, or until circumstances force you to form 
an opinion without recourse to all the facts”?</p>

What changed my perspective was a story
Jay Chiat – who set up ad agency Chiat day – used to carry a piece of paper in his pocket
When he got into an argument with someone – he’d pull it out. It read: ‘maybe they’re right’
I use that advice every day</p>

    <p>Jason it was that very attitude you described, along with the

    <p>Is this article a reaction to the kneejerk negative responses 
received on the Basecamp Next video demonstration of the sheets 
metaphor?</p>


	<p>I agree with this article to be honest – I fear I’ve lost quite a 
few business relationships due to me not being open enough to new ideas –
 something I’m actively trying to change not only for fear of losing 
respect, but also the fear of becoming stagnant and stuck in my ways.</p>


	<p>And anyway, who’s to say what’s right and what’s wrong?  Life is one
 long yarn of experiments, and getting things wrong might point you to 
the right direction later down the path.</p>

    <p>Jason, your sound advice extends beyond business and into the 
realm of personal &amp; family relationships. Taking 5 minutes after 
your partner expresses his/her feelings - especially if you interpret 
those feelings as criticism - will help you build versus erode your 
relationship. I almost lost my girlfriend of 5 years a few days ago 
because I am too quick to defend my point of view, when I should be 
listening quietly instead. After that near relationship disaster, I 
decided to make the commitment to stop trying to control the world 
around me (this is what I believe you’re ultimately describing) and just
 sit with the discomfort that often comes with losing control or having 
someone disagree with my core beliefs.</p>

    <p>When I was a kid our project was a poster graphic of a book we 
all read.  Then we did an in class review of everyones poster at the 
same time.  I criticized everyone elses project vociferously when they 
came up and no one objected.  When mine came up I didn’t say anything.  I
 thought it was perfect, but then I realized, it wasn’t as well drawn as
 person A, or as comprehensive as person B, but I had done the best job I
 could and I still believed it deserved high marks.</p>

    <p>This is such a great story because I think we all have the 
ability to be a hothead at times. It’s kind of like they saying, When 
you think you know everything, that’s when you realize you know nothing.
  I also think the five minute thing is great because that’s about how 
long it takes for you to realize that you shouldn’t say what you were 
thinking about saying, lol. This is a great piece of advice.</p>

    <p>Pro-tip:  rephrase your criticisms, assertions, etc. as questions
 before making them.  Questions are just as effective at forcing an idea
 to be evaluated based on its merits, but leave open the possibility 
that it could pass the guantlet and be right/correct/valuable/etc.  It 
also makes you look like much less of an ass if it turns out to be you 
who’s wrong, and not the idea.</p>

	<p>Its happened both when I’m presenting and when I’m part of the 
audience. The urge to say something that is different and make your 
point is strong when you feel you are right. However as you point out, 
if we give it 5 mins, it will save us from speaking too soon. Sometimes 
the speak will come around to your POV or will arrive at the point you 
want to make, eventually. Having the patience saves you from looking 
like an  Hope I remember this one.</p>

    <p>I mostly see this behavior as defensiveness due to lack of 
experience or fear of being wrong. I can remember acting that way 
occasionally in the early years of my career.</p>


	<p>I’ve learned that it actually hurts the creative flow when anyone is
 responding to a conversation in that way. Which can really have a 
negative impact on doing good work. By contrast, once there is a good 
positive dialog going, everyone has a lot more room to calmly disagree 
and work through things. Just my experience. Good post.</p>

    <p>It’s great advice. When somebody is talking, people are very 
rarely listening. They’re waiting to speak or preparing their next 
argument. By doing that, you don’t hear what the other person is saying 
and more often than not misinterpret what they are saying.</p>


	<p>It’s a skill I’m still learning and it’s a combination of patience, 
humility (I’m not always right) and a desire to learn (other people will
 know more and have better ideas than me).</p>

    <p>So true. I’d even take it one step further: before dismissing an 
idea you need to think about it, and before thinking about it you need 
to understand not only the idea, but also where it came from.</p>


	<p>In software development, you often get questions, suggestions or 
requirements from users that don’t seem to make any sense, even when 
thinking about them. But the point is they had reason for asking this 
seemingly nonsense thing. Find out their reason, and often you’ll notice
 it’s not nonsense at all. Their suggestion may not be the best way to 
solve their problem, but their problem is real. If you dismiss their 
suggested solution after thinking about it, that’s fine. But don’t 
dismiss their problem. Find a solution, whether it’s the one they 
suggested or a better one.</p>

    <p>Fabulous post Jason. I too have been learning this lesson and 
have been applying it a lot more lately to a great benefit. Perhaps the 
longer one lives the more one realizes that most arguments are 
completely inconsequential in the long term, hence the propensity to be 
more thoughtful in one’s approach to whatever it is one encounters in 
daily life. Generally, unless the circumstances are extreme, it’s much 
better to take a few breaths and walk away from the temptation to 
attack.</p>

    <p>Mr. Wurman demonstrated and asked of you what is called critical 
thinking. It’s a fundamental component of most technical pursuit.
The ability to suspend your reactions and disbelief, gather all relevant
 &amp; sufficient information first, before interpreting and judging all
 of it responsibly, in my entire career I only met a few people who did 
this quite well. I won’t claim I am also great at it.</p>

    <p>With 24 hour news on tv prominent people, experts and politicians
 are constantly being asked their opinion on events and commentary that 
have just occurred.</p>


	<p>This is too fast and the person responding has not had their “5 minutes” to really assess what has happened/been said.</p>


	<p>This leads to stupid commets that the person then has to defend even
 though it may look stupid after they reconsider the facts. --Another 
reason why our political events seem all so confusing and hard to

    <p>When I was an RA in college part of our training dealt with this,
 and a phrase that has stuck with me through the years is, “Respond, 
don’t react.”</p>


	<p>And that’s one of the things that sets us humans apart from the 
animal world – we can stop, think, and decide if a response is even 
necessary, rather than just reacting without actually thinking.</p>

    <p>I think there are two important lessons here. The first, 
obviously, give it a moment to think about it. The second one is a 
reflection on what you actually want – do you want to learn or do you 
want to be right?</p>


	<p>One thing I disagreed with is the Steve Jobs quote. To me he didn’t 
look like a person who would actually take five minutes. He was better 
known for calling things shit or holy in the fragment of a second. 
(Which doesn’t mean that he didn’t reflect later.)</p>

    <p>If you read more about Jobs you’ll see he was very contemplative,
 but not always in the moment. If you watched him in interviews, you’ll 
see often took an extended pause before he spoke. He thought a lot about
 things. And I’d have to defer to Ive, who worked with Steve every 
single day. I’m pretty sure he knew him better than we did.</p>


	<p>Of course we’re all complicated creatures, full of internal and 
external contradictions. And this wasn’t a post about Steve Jobs. I just
 happened to think the content of the quote was particularly insightful 
in the context of the rest of the point I was trying to make.</p>

realize that a truly confident person seeks first to understand.</p>

    <p>Excellent points.  
Negative reactionary behavior is definitely toxic, but remember that 
positive reactionary behavior (often overlooked because it’s so warm and
 fuzzy) is equally so. It’s no better to vigorously agree with an 
opinion without reviewing than it is to tear it down.</p>


	<p>Which direction people go when they are reacting without thinking is
 more about personality type than it is about professional expertise. In
 business, you want to be valued for your professional expertise so it 
makes sense to take a beat to let that shine through.</p>
